when some jsp files are in "WEB-INF", we can't direct request to these.
so, we must put jsp files that will use as a "Forward" destination in "WEB-INF".

How to specify to "Forward" destination
 @ jsp file -> /(path from /WebContent)
 @ Servlet class -> /URLPattern

How to specify to "Redirect" destination
 @ jsp file -> /(path from /WebContent)
 @ Servlet class -> /AppName/URLPattern



if application of transfer source equals to that of transfer destination, 
  we can use "forward" and "redirect", but "forward" is more faster than "redirect".
else,
  we can't use "forward", so we must use redirect.
